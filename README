To build packages, build the ISO and test it inside QEMU:
  # make all

For other make targets, check the Makefile.

Usage notes:
  When you upgrade the system, you might end up with the
non-patched version of Waybar, which will make your top bar
have ugly and useless whitespace if you restart it.

Maintainance notes:
  Check if Wayfire has been updated to support sending
to Waybar only the windows in the current workspace.

TODO:
  Put the source code inside the ISO.
  Figure out why wlogout sometimes errors out.
  Simple how to use app.
