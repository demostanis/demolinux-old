# Specify a `.loki` address and an optional ip range to use as an exit broker.
# Example:
# exit-node=whatever.loki # maps all exit traffic to whatever.loki
# exit-node=stuff.loki:100.0.0.0/24 # maps 100.0.0.0/24 to stuff.loki

[paths]

[dns]
# DNS configuration


# Upstream resolver(s) to use as fallback for non-loki addresses.
# Multiple values accepted.
#upstream=9.9.9.10

# Address to bind to for handling DNS requests.

# (This is not used directly by lokinet itself, but by the lokinet init scripts
# on systems which use resolveconf)
#no-resolvconf=


[bind]
# This section specifies network interface names and/or IPs as keys, and
# ports as values to control the address(es) on which Lokinet listens for
# incoming data.
# 
# Examples:
# 
#     eth0=1090
#     0.0.0.0=1090
#     1.2.3.4=1090
# 
# The first bind to port 1090 on the network interface 'eth0'; the second binds
# to port 1090 on all local network interfaces; and the third example binds to
# port 1090 on the given IP address.
# 
# If a private range IP address (or an interface with a private IP) is given, or
# if the 0.0.0.0 all-address IP is given then you must also specify the
# public-ip= and public-port= settings in the [router] section with a public
# address at which this router can be reached.
# Typically this section can be left blank: if no inbound bind addresses are
# configured then lokinet will search for a local network interface with a public
# IP address and use that (with port 1090).


# Specify a source port for **outgoing** Lokinet traffic, for example if you want to
# set up custom firewall rules based on the originating port. Typically this should
# be left unset to automatically choose random source ports.
#*=0


[api]
# JSON API settings


# Determines whether or not the LMQ JSON API is enabled. Defaults 
#enabled=1

# IP address and port to bind to.
# Recommend localhost-only for security purposes.
#bind=tcp://127.0.0.1:1190


[bootstrap]
# Configure nodes that will bootstrap us onto the network


# Whether or not to run as a seed node. We will not have any bootstrap routers configured.
#seed-node=0

# Specify a bootstrap file containing a signed RouterContact of a service node
# which can act as a bootstrap. Can be specified multiple times.
#add-node=


[logging]
# logging settings


# Log type (format). Valid options are:
#   file - plaintext formatting
#   syslog - logs directed to syslog
#type=file

# Minimum log level to print. Logging below this level will be ignored.
# Valid log levels, in ascending order, are:
#   trace
#   debug
#   info
#   warn
#   error
#level=warn

# When using type=file this is the output filename. If given the value 'stdout' or
# left empty then logging is printed as standard output rather than written to a
# file.
#file=
